# WYS_key-algo_tester

If you dont know what this is,
go play 'Will you Snail?' by Jonas Tyroller
and come back when you find a room with binary written on the wall.
Then look at this google doc docs.google.com/document/d/1e_nOhSkTh9cchh8n5yDadvf-pnoi8CBZnHwZE0dsbcI
to get all the info you need.

The level 5 hints implies that we migth need to modify the key 'INTELLIGENCECHECK' in some way to get the correct key.
So I made a little program with the Godot engine for the UI
to help anyone who wants to decrypt this puzzle.
